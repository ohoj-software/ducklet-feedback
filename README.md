# Ducklet for SQLite - Issue Tracker


ðŸ˜” We have made the difficult decision to discontinue Ducklet. While we had high hopes for this product, it has unfortunately not proven to be commercially viable, and as a result, we can no longer dedicate the time and resources necessary to support it moving forward.


We deeply appreciate the trust you placed in us by using Ducklet, and we understand that this news may come as a disappointment. 

As a small team, with a single developer behind the application, it has become increasingly challenging to maintain and improve the product to meet the evolving needs of our users.
We want to thank you for your support and feedback over the course of Ducklet's journey. Your engagement has meant a great deal to us, and we are truly grateful for the opportunity to have served you.
